# Tools involved
Java programming Andriod Studio (IDE) with implementing openGLES and a wavefront obj reader library (https://github.com/javagl/Obj)

# Render_ObjFile_to_Mobile_Using_OpenGLES
This Project Only Render simple Object on a mobile screen without Considering texture and its normal of it. However, you can still use the data from the (Wavefront reader library) to retrieve texture and normal coordinate and their indexes and update the object in your own way.


# This project is:
Complete assignment for rendering .obj to mobile screen using OpenGLES (with basic computer graphic pipeline setup for reading input objfile with wavefront library, vertex/index/teexcoor buffers ,vertex shader, fragment shader, model/view/projection matrix (camera) setup). the sample of an virus objfile is include in the project assests folder
