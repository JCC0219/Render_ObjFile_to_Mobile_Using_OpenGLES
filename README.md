# Tools involved
Java programming with Andriod Studio (IDE), implementing openGLES and a wavefront obj reader library from (https://github.com/javagl/Obj)

# Render_ObjFile_to_Mobile_Using_OpenGLES:
Complete assignment for rendering .obj to mobile screen using OpenGLES (with basic computer graphic pipeline setup for reading input obj file with wavefront library, vertex&index buffers, vertex shader, fragment shader, model/view/projection matrix (camera) setup). the sample of a virus obj file is included in the project assets folder

# Note: 
This Project Only Render simple Object on a mobile screen without Considering texture and its normal. However, you can still use the data from the (Wavefront reader library) to retrieve texture and normal coordinate and their indexes and update the object in your own way.
